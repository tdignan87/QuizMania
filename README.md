## UX (User Experience) 
### Project Goals
The projects goal is to create a simple to use game, which can be used on any device and can be enjoyed by adults and children. The website needs to be simple with easy functionality and appealing enough to encourage users to stay and play the quiz game.

### User Stories
##### User 1:
As a user i want to be able to use this page to play this game easily. The ideal scenario would be a game that you dont need to download from any app store and you can play directly from the browser on any device.

##### User 2:
As a user i want to see simple navigation with not to crowded options. Most game sites are over crowded with lots of content.

##### User 3:
I want my 7 year old kid to be able to play this game with ease. I want them to be able to play over and over without too many menus to choose from.

##### User 4:
I want a trivia game website that doesn't require registration or is packed with lots of content that doesnt look good on my phone or ipad.  I want a good simple design that looks well on any of my devices.
