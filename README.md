## UX (User Experience) 
### Project Goals
The projects goal is to create a simple to use game, which can be used on any device and can be enjoyed by adults and children. The website needs to be simple with easy functionality and appealing enough to encourage users to stay and play the quiz game.

### User Goals
* A website that allows us to test our general knowledge by playing the trivia game.
* Visual interaction of my progress would be good.
* Ability to view scores to see how i have performed against other family members.
* A variety of different questions each time i play the trivia game.

### User Stories
##### User 1:
As a user i want to be able to use this page to play this game easily. The ideal scenario would be a game that you dont need to download from any app store and you can play directly from the browser on any device.

##### User 2:
As a user i want to see simple navigation with not to crowded options. Most game sites are over crowded with lots of content.

##### User 3:
I want my 7 year old kid to be able to play this game with ease. I want them to be able to play over and over without too many menus to choose from.

##### User 4:
I want a trivia game website that doesn't require registration or is packed with lots of content that doesnt look good on my phone or ipad.  I want a good simple design that looks well on any of my devices.


### Owner Goals

* As the owner i want to provide a game that is fun for all the family of all ages.
* As the owner i want easily functionality.
* As the owner i don't want to overcrowd the site with lots of content.
* As the owner i would like to eceive improvement ideas through the contact us page.


### Expectations
* Can view scores of each game round.
* Can see progress at any time of how well they are doing.
* API generates different questions each round of playing.
* Navigation takes user to specific parts of the page.
* Contact Us form pops out and allows user to complete form.
* Content isn't overcrowded and visually good on all devices.

### Design Process
This project is a simple trivia game for all ages and therefore my design choices are positive stand out colors with minimum page crowding and a stand out text color over the background color.

##### Fonts
I chose the font Bubble Gums Sans as the font is upbeat and fun which is what i want the user to experience when playing the game. This font is used throughout the whole webpage. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans">Click Here!</a> to view on google fonts.

##### Icons
I chose font awesome icons to display the facebook logo page. Once QuizMania is set up with a social media account it will then be set up with the correct link.
#### Colors
The main text is orange with a lighter orange for the buttons. Text is a contract between black and white and all colors go well with the overall design of the website.

#### Styling
I used bootstrap 4 for styling the responsive design to the page. 


#### Wireframes
I build the wireframes for this project using Balsamiq Mockups 3. I started by creating a wireframe on the browser view and then worked my way to create a tablet and phone desing. My wireframes can be viewed at the following link.

## Features

### Known Bugs

## Deployment
I used VS Code for developing this project using gitHub to hold the repository.
When configuring my project for Github the following steps were taken
 
 1. Created new github workspace on my github account.
 2. Installed Git on Windows.
 3. Created a local repo in VS code once git was fully installed.
 4. Source control section of VS code i selected manage, clone and then pasted in my github repository path to clone too.
 5. Double checked after initial setup that the cloning was working successfully and to the correct repository.
