## UX (User Experience) 
### Project Goals
The projects goal is to create a simple to use game, which can be used on any device and can be enjoyed by adults and children. The website needs to be simple with easy functionality and appealing enough to encourage users to stay and play the quiz game.

### User Goals
* A website that allows us to test our general knowledge by playing the trivia game.
* Visual interaction of my progress would be good.
* Ability to view scores to see how i have performed against other family members.
* A variety of different questions each time i play the trivia game.

### User Stories

##### User 2:
As a user i want to see simple navigation with not to crowded options. Most game sites are over crowded with lots of content.

##### User 3:

## Design Process
This project is a simple trivia game for all ages and therefore my design choices are positive stand out colors with minimum page crowding and a stand out text color over the background color.

##### Fonts
I chose the font Bubble Gums Sans as the font is upbeat and fun which is what i want the user to experience when playing the game. This font is used throughout the whole webpage. <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bubblegum+Sans">Click Here!</a> to view on google fonts.

##### Icons
I chose font awesome icons to display QuizMania's social media pages at the footer of the page. The colors of the icons blended well with the rest of the content on the page. 

#### Colors
I did a lot of searching online to find similar games and they all use boldish stand out colors. I decided to implement this using a mixture of colors below
